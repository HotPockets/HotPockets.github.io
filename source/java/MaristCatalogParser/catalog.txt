"MOIRA FITZGIBBONS, Ph.D., Core/LS Director"
-
"MISSION:"
-
"One enduring element of the mission of Marist College has been to provide students with an experience that blends career preparation with an education in the tradition of the liberal arts. The commitment of the faculty to providing students with a rounded education is evident in the Core/Liberal Studies Program which emphasizes the following goals:"
-
"• To assist and challenge students to become more aware of their own values and the ethical implications of the choices they face in their public and private worlds."
-
"• To develop in students the capacity to synthesize and integrate methods and insights from a variety of intellectual disciplines."
-
"• To introduce students to the essential ideas and skills that comprise the disciplines of the liberal arts and the sciences."
-
"• To develop in students crucial 21st-century skills including critical thinking, written exposition, public presentation, information literacy, and technological competency."
-
"To achieve these goals, students are exposed to a curriculum that is both integrative and distributive, blending courses that all students take as part of a shared educational experience with elective courses in the liberal arts and sciences."
-
"The Foundation courses in the Core/Liberal Studies Program introduce students to the College as an intellectual community and instruct them in skills they will use throughout their undergraduate experience and beyond. The First Year Seminar introduces students to critical thinking, writing, public presentation, information literacy, and interdisciplinary study through exploration of a focused topic. The other required Foundation course, Writing for College, enables students to develop their ability to critically analyze and learn through writing. Students also learn methods of scholarly documentation and the organization and presentation of ideas. These skills are essential for success in academic and professional life. Each First Year Seminar and Writing for College course engages with one or more of the following themes central to liberal learning: Civic Engagement, Cultural Diversity, Nature & the Environment, and Quantitative Reasoning."
-
"The Core/LS Program’s distribution requirements introduce students to a broad range of disciplines and develop their ability to approach problems in an integrative manner. Breadth courses are content-based and emphasize an understanding of the skills, methodology, and ethical issues of each discipline. Philosophical Perspectives, a Breadth course taken by all students, enables students to examine basic philosophical questions concerning knowledge (epistemology), reality (metaphysics), and human values (ethics, political philosophy, aesthetics) essential to the College’s curriculum as a whole. The 12-credit Pathway component of the distribution requirements offers students the opportunity to explore disparate approaches to a focused interdisciplinary topic."
-
"In order to build on the skill instruction provided in the Foundation courses, the Core/LS Program requires that each student complete an “intensive” course in the following skill areas: writing, public presentation, and technological competency. These courses may overlap with courses taken for the Core/LS Program or in the major field of study."
-
"The required Capping Course is a discipline-based experience that addresses the general concerns of the discipline within a wider context and further develops the skills and values awareness developed throughout the Core/Liberal Studies Program."
-
"The Core/Liberal Studies Program outlined below is in effect for all incoming freshmen in Fall 2013 and afterward except students in the Liberal Studies Major."
-
"Students who entered the College prior to Fall 2013 should consult earlier versions of the catalog. Students transferring to Marist may receive Core/Liberal Studies credit for courses previously taken. Core/Liberal Studies courses cannot be taken Pass/No Credit."
-
"Once a student has matriculated at Marist, the Core/Liberal Studies Capping Course requirements must be fulfilled at Marist College."

"Marist College encourages qualified students to spend a semester or academic year in another country through Marist International Programs (MIP). Students of virtually every major may study/intern abroad for at least one semester."
-
"Interested students should begin planning their semester/year abroad with their academic advisor as early as possible. Candidates for MIP may variously pursue major, minor, core, internship, or elective coursework abroad. Again, early planning is essential in terms of course planning and finding the best fit between particular study abroad program and student. Students generally earn 15 credits per semester while abroad."

"DELLA LEE SUE, Ph.D., Chairperson"
-
"MISSION:"
-
"Today’s accounting majors are expected not only to provide auditing, accounting, and tax services for small and large companies, but also to provide services in forecasting, financial planning and evaluation, and the creation and monitoring of new technologies."
-
"The accounting program at Marist College provides a high-quality, professional education in a supportive, interactive, and personalized learning environment. The program is designed to prepare accounting graduates to progress to sensitive management positions in business and industry, public accounting, and governmental units."
-
"Professional opportunities include careers as a certified public accountant (CPA) or as a certified management accountant (CMA). The Marist Bachelor of Science in Accounting also serves as a sound educational base for post-baccalaureate study in business and law."
-
"As of August 2009, 150 credit hours are required to sit for the CPA exam."
-
"The Accounting Core (30 credits)"
-
"The Accounting Core requires an intensive study of the various responsibilities of the accountant. This includes the study of financial accounting theory, its realization in generally accepted accounting principles, and the application of official accounting and auditing standards as well as tax laws."

"The Interface between Accounting and Business (27 credits)"
-
"Accounting involves both external financial reporting and internal reporting for managerial decision making and control. Hence, professional accountants interact with all the functional areas of business. Accounting majors develop their knowledge of this interface through both required and elective courses."
-
"Required Courses (18 credits)"
-
"For the Accounting profession taken as a whole the primary interface with business requires a detailed knowledge of the financial and legal aspects of business transactions. Consequently, the required interface courses develop expertise in these areas."

-
-
-
"• broaden their exposure to include the other functional disciplines in business,"
-
-
-
"• focus on a particular interface that reflects their interests and career aspirations, or"
-
-
-
"• emphasize further study of Accounting topics."
-
"NOTE: Internship credits can count for no more than 3 of the elective credits described in this section."
-
"The Integrative Capping Course (3 credits)"
-
"The professional practice of accounting requires accountants"
-
"• to critically interpret and apply accounting principles and standards to complex transactions"
-

-
"which often involve innovative contracts and contingent claims,"
-
"• to evaluate the value of information for managerial decision making, and"

"MARTIN SHAFFER, Ph.D., Coordinator"
-
"An interdepartmental program involving history, politics, law, literature, philosophy, religion, art, and music, American Studies allows students to transcend narrow disciplinary boundaries in exploring the broad interplay of ideas and events which have shaped the American past."
-
"This requires a careful selection among designated courses within the American arena, while also developing a concentration (12 credits) focusing upon a different culture such as that of Latin America, England, or Russia. A 3-credit senior capping experience then unifies these perspectives upon the American Experience."

"TRACEY MCGRAIL, Ph.D., Chairperson"
-
"MISSION:"
-
"The Applied Mathematics major provides a strong foundation in traditional mathematics, but additionally is interdisciplinary in nature as it addresses the needs of those students interested in scientific or operational applications of mathematical techniques. Such applications can be found in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, computer science, finance, actuarial science, operations research, industrial mathematics, and many others. These applications require an understanding of the appropriate field, so students are expected to choose one of four subfields outside of mathematics in which to specialize."
-
"REQUIREMENTS FOR A BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS"
-
"Note: A minimum of 60 credits in Liberal Arts is required."

"ART AND DIGITAL MEDIA"

"DONISE ENGLISH, M.F.A., Chairperson"
-
"MISSION:"
-
"The Department of Art and Digital Media believes a sound foundation and an exploration of the fields of digital media, studio art, and art history should be combined with a strong liberal arts education to expand the intellectual horizons of our students. The department seeks ways to broaden their intellectual development through the investigation of state-of-the-art technologies in addition to traditional forms of study and techniques. The department believes an education in the visual arts should go beyond the classroom, lab, and studio. Opportunities are provided to exhibit artwork, visit galleries and museums, obtain internships, and study abroad."
-
"The Department’s mission is to prepare students for careers and graduate study in the fine and applied arts."
-
"The B.S. in Digital Media is designed to allow students the opportunity to explore, in depth, the new exciting field of Digital Media under the guidance of recognized working artists, designers, and educators. It combines courses in digital media with a balanced curriculum of studio art, art history, and liberal arts courses. Students will gain broad-based training in a wide range of new media, along with an understanding of their concepts, historical background, and heritage in the traditional media."
-
"The B.S. in Studio Art offers a balance of courses between the traditional art media areas required by the major and the liberal arts courses required by the Marist College common Core. This program will provide a concentrated and carefully structured series of courses organized to enable students to broaden their understanding, aesthetic awareness, and technical abilities in the studio arts. It will also stress the concepts and historical background that have determined the way in which traditional art media have evolved. In addition, this comprehensive program will encourage an awareness of art in relationship to other areas, provide art students with the opportunity to participate in internships, take related courses in other disciplines, and offer students an opportunity to develop their portfolios in preparation for graduate studies. The Studio Faculty is composed of full-time and visiting art professionals who are committed to creating a nurturing but challenging environment in which students can explore, experiment, and develop their own personal visions."
-
"The B.A. in Fine Arts with a concentration in Studio Art is designed to combine a broad-based training in the visual arts with a traditional liberal arts education."
-
"After gaining a solid foundation in design, drawing, and art history, each student specializes in one of five tracks: drawing, graphic design, painting, photography, or digital media. Students also select additional studio courses to expand their knowledge of the visual arts. This curriculum is ideally suited for students who want to combine their studio major with a second one or plan a more rigorous study of the liberal arts."
-
"The B.A. in Fine Arts with a concentration in Art History is designed to provide both a survey of western art and an in-depth study of selected periods. In addition to the required coursework, students concentrating in art history must pursue an alternative discipline, preferably in a foreign language. Study abroad is strongly encouraged and the department provides many opportunities for doing so."
-
"All majors, whether in Studio Art, Digital Media, or Art History, are encouraged to apply for internships in their junior or senior year. The Department’s programs are augmented by trips to nearby galleries and museums in the Hudson Valley, New England, and New York City. There are also noteworthy opportunities to study abroad, particularly at our branch campus in Florence, Italy, as well as short-term programs to Italy, England, France, Spain, and Japan."

Students majoring in Breadth areas may apply a maximum of 6 credits to their distribution total. If applicable to a Pathway, 3 credits may come from disciplines outside of Core Breadth areas. Although foreign language and culture courses are not required within the Core, some courses in these fields may be used to fulfill distribution requirements."

"MICHAEL E. POWERS, Ph.D., ATC, Chair/Program Director"
-
"MISSION:"
-
"The mission of the Athletic Training Education Program is to provide students, within a liberal-arts framework, with the strong scientific foundation and extensive practical experience they need to become certified Athletic Trainers (ATC). Athletic Training is an area of health care concerned with prevention, recognition, care, and rehabilitation of sports-related and similar injuries. Athletic Trainers work as part of a comprehensive sports-medicine team that includes physicians, physical therapists, and other health-care professionals. Upon completion of the B.S. degree in Athletic Training at Marist, graduates will be eligible to sit for the certification examination administered by the Board of Certification, Inc. (BOC). Those passing this exam will be certified as Athletic Trainers by the BOC. The baccalaureate program qualifies students for entry-level positions in high schools, colleges, and universities; professional sports organizations; hospitals and medical clinics; and corporate and industrial settings. Students also may go on for further study in graduate and professional schools. Marist’s Athletic Training Education Program (ATEP) is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE) and is registered with the New York State Education Department as a licensure-qualifying degree program."
-
"The ATEP begins with a pre-professional phase which consists of introductory athletic training, biology, and chemistry courses in preparation for full acceptance into the ATEP. Students are also required to complete 60 hours of observation during this phase and submit an application for acceptance into the professional phase of the program. The deadline for application to the ATEP is November 1st for transfer students and March 1st for freshman and transfer students during the first full year at Marist. Admission to the program is competitive and based upon academic performance, references, and an essay, as well as successful completion of the first year’s coursework and observation-hour requirement. An interview may be requested. Transfer admission requirements are available by contacting the Program Director of Athletic Training or the Director of Transfer Admission at Marist College. Applications to the ATEP are available in the Department of Athletic Training. Enrollment in the ATEP is limited to allow an effective student-to-clinical-instructor ratio. Upon full acceptance into the ATEP students must have a physical examination, current CPR/AED certification, training in blood-borne pathogens, complete a technical standards document, and adhere to the Retention Policy. Information on each of these requirements is available in the Department of Athletic Training and can be found in the Athletic Training Student Policy and Procedures Manual. Students are required to purchase clothing and a watch to meet dress code requirements for the ATEP.

"BIOLOGY EDUCATION"
-
"In partnership with the Department of Teacher Education in the School of Social & Behavioral Sciences, the Department of Biology has established a curriculum that leads to provisional New York State certification in Adolescence Education with a specialization in Biology. This curriculum, approved by the New York State Education Department, includes courses in biology and the other natural sciences, as well as courses designed to prepare students for a secondary school teaching career. A supervised student teaching experience, arranged by Marist faculty, is included."
-
"Requirements for New York State Teacher Certification in Adolescence Education: Biology (Grades 7-12)"
-
"Marist College offers a state-approved program leading to initial teacher certification in Adolescence Education: Biology (Grades 7-12). Students seeking this certification are encouraged to consult with their academic advisor and the Coordinator of Adolescence Education in the Teacher Education Department. Because of the significant number of state certification requirements for this program, it is important that students seek such advisement early in their college careers, during the freshman year if possible. Education and related field requirements for Adolescence Education certification can be found on page 102 of this catalog."
-
"Program Requirements"
-
"Admission into EDUC 422 and EDUC 464 (Student Teaching) is based on the following:"
-
"• A BIOL (major field) grade-point average of 2.7 or higher with no grade below a C (average calculated based only on BIOL courses that can be applied to the BIOL major). NOTE: transfer students must take 12 credits in upper-level BIOL classes at Marist"
-
"• An overall science GPA of 2.5 or higher with no grade below a C (BIOL major field and related field requirements- this includes the required CHEM and MATH"
-
"courses along with the BIOL courses required for the major)"
-
"• A minimum overall GPA of 2.7"
-
"• Grades of C+ or higher in all required courses for the education certificate (see Education Requirements)"
-
"Prior to admission to EDUC 422, the student must successfully complete at least 10 credits in upper-level BIOL courses (transfer students must successfully complete at least 8 credits in upper-level BIOL courses at Marist)."
-
"Prior to admission to EDUC 464, the student must successfully complete all BIOL courses required by the major (transfer students must successfully complete at least 12 credits in upper-level BIOL courses at Marist)."

"BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES"
-
"The Biomedical Sciences curriculum is an interdisciplinary science program that includes core courses in biology, chemistry, and physics. These courses provide a solid foundation in each of these basic sciences and serve as general prerequisites for admission to most health professional schools. Elective and Core/LS courses will satisfy additional admission prerequisites to master’s and doctoral programs in the health sciences. These schools include, but are not limited to, medical, dental, veterinary, physical therapy, optometry, chiropractic, physician assistant, pharmacy, nursing, public health, and genetic counseling."
-
"In addition to providing students with grounding in the basic and biomedical sciences, this curriculum allows students whose goals and interests are not in clinical practice to pursue other avenues of opportunity. For example, it also will prepare students for graduate study (i.e., research-based M.S. and Ph.D. degrees) in a wide range of fields in the life sciences, including cellular and developmental biology, molecular genetics and molecular biology, immunology, and other biomedical sciences. Also, many vocations are available to graduates who seek no additional formal education beyond the B.S. degree. These include careers in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical diagnostics industries; hospital and independent testing labs; academic biomedical research; and state/federal health or research labs."
-
"Two features of the program – the Introduction to the Health Professions course and required internships in a clinical setting – provide focused information about and direct experience with the health-care system. While most internships will be served locally at Mid-Hudson Regional Hospital, Vassar Brothers Medical Center, or other health-care providers, in many cases students may be able to arrange internships in their hometowns. The inclusion of Business courses as Biomedical Sciences electives represents a distinct difference from any other program of this type, and provides students with the management background so strongly recommended by our Pre-Med/Pre-Health Advisory Board. Students can tailor their coursework and complete any remaining requirements via judicious choice of Biomedical Sciences and free electives, with the help of a faculty advisor."
-
"However, for medical and most other health professional schools, students can choose any major – including Athletic Training, Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science, or Medical Technology – prior to professional school application. We note that Marist’s Biomedical Sciences curriculum, as well as the Biology and Biochemistry curricula at Marist, includes all the prerequisite undergraduate courses for the great majority of professional schools."

Only 4 of these 7 credits may be Biology Research credits (BIOL 480-483). Required Biomedical Sciences courses cannot serve as Biomedical Sciences Electives. The specific combination of courses may contribute to a minor (such as in Business, which is strongly recommended by Marist’s Pre-Med/Pre-Health Professions Advisory Board), include categorical certification in one of the Medical Technology specialty areas, or serve to meet other educational needs of the student."

-
"The broad exposure to business provided by the Business Core is necessary, but not sufficient, for the Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration. To develop the capability to contribute to an organization’s competitiveness, the student must also acquire more advanced expertise in an area of emphasis. The School of Management encourages each business administration major to select an area of emphasis that"
-
-
-
"• reflects his or her interests and talents, and"
-
-
-
"• leads to fulfillment of both career aspirations and employers’ expectations."
-
"Students may only select one area of emphasis."
-
"To fulfill employers’ expectations for entry-level management positions, and thereby enhance first employment opportunities, students frequently select courses which emphasize one of the following areas:"
-
-
-
"• Finance (ECON 422, BUS 420, BUS 421, ACCT 330)"
-
-
-
"• International Business (BUS 430, BUS 442, ECON 442) and one class chosen from the following list:"

"MISSION:"
-
"The mission of the Department of Chemistry, Biochemistry, & Physics is for students and faculty to acquire a better and more systematic understanding of the physical world and to disseminate new discoveries to the greater scientific community. Faculty expand the knowledge, skills, and values of all students, and help transition their learning styles from passive to active."
-
"In support of this mission, a research-rich, challenging curriculum engages undergraduate chemistry and biochemistry majors amidst a supportive environment featuring exceptional access to faculty and facilities. Two American Chemical Society-approved curricula emphasize extensive hands-on experience with state-of-the-art instrumentation and development of effective communication skills. Computational modeling is integrated throughout the curriculum as one mechanism to blend contemporary practice with traditional methods. A strong sense of community grows from personal attention and individualized mentoring from faculty and support from fellow students."
-
"Students are therefore the central focus and an integral part of the Department, working side-by-side with faculty who are enthusiastically committed to the teacher-scholar model. Faculty strive to be nationally recognized in their areas of specialization by working in research partnerships with students as colleagues. Most departmental majors complete original research projects, many of which culminate in presentation or publication at the national level. Marist Chemistry graduates are superbly prepared to be critically thinking, ethical scientist-citizens, with a balanced understanding of theory and method. Such graduates will be successful regardless of the paths they follow after leaving Marist College."
-
"In pursuit of the philosophy of “Science without Boundaries,” the Department actively seeks to collaborate with students and faculty from other disciplines. The Department cherishes its role in training students majoring in the other sciences, because the physical sciences underlie processes integral to the life sciences and health professions. The Department recognizes its responsibility to contribute to the understanding and thinking of non-science majors via its involvement in the Core/Liberal Studies program. Faculty and students also use their expertise to provide service to the College and the mid-Hudson Valley."
-
"Departmental Goals"
-
"• To be nationally recognized by high schools as a place to send their best students and by graduate schools as a place to recruit high-quality students."
-
"• To place graduating students in competitive positions of their choice in graduate schools, professional schools, secondary schools, and industry."
-
"• To provide an environment which fosters continued professional growth of the faculty, including the ability to stay active and vital in their respective fields of research."
-
"• To engage students in publication-quality research."
-
"• To contribute to increased scientific knowledge through presentations and publications."
-
"Goals for Students"
-
"Students Will:"
-
"• Achieve Understanding: Chemistry education at Marist College will emphasize depth of understanding over memorization. Faculty and curricula will foster the ability to solve problems through the understanding and application of fundamental scientific principles. Students will demonstrate factual knowledge by application of key concepts to solve theoretical, laboratory, and research problems."
-
"• Develop Skills: Students will develop skills in: laboratory procedure; data keeping and processing; teamwork and leadership; mathematical reasoning; computational methods; retrieval and use of informational resources; and oral and written communication. Students also will learn and practice safe and responsible methods for chemical work."
-
"• Develop Values: Students will be held to the highest ethical standards in everything they do, including the recording and reporting of data. Students will also be exposed to other ethical issues in science, including responsible treatment of data, reporting scientific information, ethical misconduct, issues in human and animal experimentation, and the relationship of chemistry to society."
-
"• Learn Research Methods: Most of our students will learn research methods by participating in original research, working closely with a faculty member. Those who don’t undertake extensive research projects nevertheless will be exposed to the techniques and methods of chemical research through laboratory work."
-
"• Increase Awareness of Self: Students will become aware of their personal learning styles so that they can develop intellectually and continue to grow intellectually."
-
"Degree Options in Chemistry"
-
"In order to provide a versatile set of programs for students while maintaining the high quality of the Marist Chemistry experience, we offer four degree options. The B.S. Chemistry and B.S. Chemistry-Biochemistry curricula accommodate those students seeking certification from the American Chemical Society as they prepare for careers as professional scientists in the chemical, pharmaceutical, or molecular industries, or as health-care practitioners. These curricula are recommended for those anticipating graduate-level (M.S. or Ph.D.) study in chemistry, biochemistry, or biomedical sciences. The more flexible B.A. Chemistry and B.A. Biochemistry curricula are designed to have significant quantities of free electives, allowing students to pursue personal and professional interests in other areas such as, but not limited to, business, education, and computer science. The B.A. Chemistry degree is especially well suited for those seeking provisional certification to teach chemistry in secondary schools in New York State or for marketing and sales positions in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. The B.A. Biochemistry degree, with proper choice of electives, may be used as preparation for students seeking a career in the health professions."

"COGNITIVE SCIENCE MINOR"

"KRISTIN JAY, Ph.D, Co-Director"
-
"Cognitive Science is an interdisciplinary program that offers students the ability to study the nature of cognition and its importance in our lives. All students take four foundation courses (Introduction to Psychology, Philosophical Perspectives, Foundations of Cognitive Science, and Moral Cognition) and four distribution courses. The distribution courses come from Anthropology, Biology, Computer Science, English, Mathematics, Philosophy, and Psychology. In fulfilling the distribution requirement, students must take courses in at least three of those disciplines. Of the courses in the distribution requirement, no more than one course can be at the 100-level, at least two courses must be 300-level or above, and no more than two courses (which must be 300-level or above) can be from the student’s major field of study. Coursework for the minor must be completed with a C average."
-
"The minor is appropriate for students interested in exploring different dimensions of cognition, including but not limited to the neurobiological underpinnings of cognitive processes, the role of cognition in the productio of purposeful behavior and in making moral judgments, and cognition in non-human animals and computers."
-
"The minor will also be useful in preparing interested students for graduate work in any of the various cognate disciplines that together comprise the field of cognitive science."
-
"The minor requires a total of 24 credits distributed as follows:"

"COMMUNICATION"
-
"SHANNON ROPER, Ph.D., Chairperson"
-
"MISSION:"
-
"The program is designed to challenge students interested in studying the many forms of human communication – its process, outcomes, and effects. The core of this investigation centers on the ways in which human beings purposefully utilize symbols in interaction to create or modify a socially meaningful world. Through courses and internships, the program combines a strong liberal arts background with a professional focus. Inherent in the program’s courses and internships is the integration of communication theories and the liberal arts tradition. This is accomplished through the strategic application of theory to the hands-on practice of communication."
-
"The opportunity for internships is readily available, as the strong alumni network of the School ensures that our students intern in some of the top communication organizations in the Northeast, including the major television networks, public-relations firms, radio stations, newspapers, nonprofit and human-service agencies, and Fortune 500 companies. This on-the-job training helps graduates as they prepare to enter this exciting and ever-changing profession."
-
"OBJECTIVES:"
-
"Students graduating with a major in Communication should:"
-
-
-
"(1) have an understanding of communication theory and the ability to translate this theory successfully into practice; (2) be able to speak and write effectively;"
-
-
-
"(3) be able to function knowledgeably and critically as consumers and practitioners in the diverse fields of communication; (4) be media literate;"
-
-
-
"(5) have competence in critical thinking and problem solving;"
-
-
-
"(6) have an awareness of the moral and ethical issues involved in human communication."
-
"The Communication program offers concentrations in Advertising, Communication Studies, Journalism, Public Relations, and Sports Communication. Communication is a discipline that involves the study of symbolic behavior in many contexts. Regardless of their specialties, communicators are involved in fundamentally similar activities. They gather and process information and create and disseminate messages. Advertisers, journalists, public-relations practitioners, public speakers, television, radio, film, or multimedia producers, and all who communicate with others, engage in these essential operations."
-
"Minor and Certificate Programs:"
-
"The program also includes a minor in Communication for those students who wish to combine the study of communication with a major in another discipline."

"MISSION:"
-
"The mission of the Department of Computing Technology is to prepare students for lifelong careers in the study, design, development, and implementation of hardware, software, and software systems. After completing a program within the Department, a student will:"
-
"• Have received instruction in the theoretical foundations of Computer Science, which will form a structure on which specific skills will be built throughout an individual’s career."
-
"• Have been introduced to current computing technologies, as appropriate to the field."
-
"• Be an independent learner who can remain up to date in a rapidly changing field."
-
"• Be able to make socially and ethically responsible decisions about the uses of technology."
-
"The Department of Computing Technology is committed to providing its students with a broad range of opportunities both on and off the Marist College campus, including internships in the business community that provide many students with experience in their chosen fields."
-
"The Department of Computing Technology is also committed to providing technical competency education to the entire Marist student community."
-
"The major in Computer Science is designed to provide students with a broad background in many aspects of Computer Science. The foundation is then supplemented by advanced courses that are selected by the students to correspond to their personal and career interests."

-
"EITEL LAURIA, Ph.D., Director"
-
"In addition to its undergraduate major in Computer Science, the Department of Computing Technology also offers a Master of Computer Science/Software Development degree. The Department recognizes that for some outstanding undergraduate students, certain of their undergraduate work might well be reflective of both the content and quality of that typically expected at the graduate level. The Department thus recognizes that these students could participate successfully in graduate classes. For these reasons the Department offers a five-year program in Computer Science, at the end of which the student will earn both B.S. and M.S. degrees."
-
"This program offers an accelerated way of obtaining a Master’s Degree. Instead of remaining three additional semesters as full-time students to gain the MS at 151"
-
"credits (120 + 31), those CS undergraduate students who are admitted to this program will be required to take only 143 credits, or 23 additional credits that can be completed in two semesters, normally the fall and spring following their undergraduate studies."
-
"The five-year program is not appropriate for all students. Qualification occurs in the sixth semester. A cumulative GPA of 3.0, as well as a GPA of 3.0 in the major, is required for acceptance into and continuation in the program. Students interested in entering the five-year program should speak to any CS faculty member early in their studies at Marist, but no later than the beginning of their sixth semester. A faculty recommendation is required for admittance into the program."
-
"92 B.S./M.S. Program in Computer Science"
-
"Five-Year Program"
-
"The Five-Year program allows undergraduates to earn a B.S. and a M.S. degree in five years. In the current program, students apply in second semester junior year and if accepted, begin the five-year program in the first semester of what would have been their senior year. Students in the current program earn 143 credits."
-
"The Five-Year program in the revised MSCS/SD program is modeled on the current program. The differences are only in the courses the students take and the number of credits in the revised program, which are 144 credits."
-
"The table below gives the full five-year program, starting with freshman year. Starting in the fall of the senior year students take Software Design & Dev instead of CS Project I."
-
"In the spring of senior year, students take Database Mgt Sys and Track course 1 instead of CS Project II and the undergraduate Elective/Internship."
-
"In the fall of the fifth-year, students take Security Protocols, Networks, and Track course 2."
-
"In the spring of the fifth year, students take Project and two graduate electives."
-
"These details are in the table below. Note → indicates the replacement graduate course for the undergraduate course and credits."

"CRIMINAL JUSTICE"
-
"JOHN F. DOHERTY, Ph.D., Department Chair"
-
"MISSION:"
-
"The major in Criminal Justice combines a broad Core/Liberal Arts curriculum with the theory, practice, and experience specific to criminal justice. All courses focus on the study of crime from a variety of perspectives: cause of crime, societal reaction, judicial processing and treatment of offenders, as well as the philosophy and practice of social control and administration of criminal behavior. Emphasis is also placed on critical thinking and problem solving."
-
"The curriculum culminates with two senior seminar courses, which brings together all facets of the Marist College undergraduate experience and the lessons learned in the major. A mandatory six-credit internship enables the Criminal Justice major to experience practical criminal justice from a variety of criminal justice and allied agencies. Internship placements include the range of federal, state, and local agencies."
-
"Experiencing criminal justice in both the classroom and professional world enables students to make informed career choices. Major curriculum completion, coupled with all Core/Liberal Arts requirements, leads to the Bachelor of Science degree in Criminal Justice. A minor in Criminal Justice is also available."
-
"It is possible for students who plan carefully early in their college careers to double major in Criminal Justice and Psychology. To pursue this option, students should contact the Chair of Criminal Justice or Psychology."
-

Outstanding, academically successful (minimum of 3.2 GPA), and highly motivated Marist undergraduate candidates in Psychology and the Dual-Certificate education program may consider applying to the five-year program which combines the Psychology in Childhood 1-6/Students with Disabilities 1-6 undergraduate program with the M.A. in Educational Psychology program. Marist candidates in the five-year program will receive a B.A. in Psychology, earn a New York State Initial Teaching Certificate in Childhood Education 1-6/ Students with Disabilities grades 1-6, as well as an M.A. in Educational Psychology. The five–year program is a 36-credit graduate program."
-
"In this program candidates complete 12 credits of graduate courses starting in the spring semester of their junior year, prior to the completion of the B.A. degree program. Student teaching will be completed in the spring semester of their senior year as part of the B.S. degree requirement. The remaining 24 credits are completed in the fifth year, with graduate student status. Admission to this program is granted to qualified applicants in the fall semester of their junior year. The program is a cohort-based program and fits only for undergraduate candidates who graduate with their Bachelor degree in spring. Inquiry about admission should be made to the Director of Graduate Education Programs (Dr. Zsuzsanna Szabo, zsuzsanna.szabo@marist.edu). Application should be submitted in the fall semester of the junior year."
-
"ENGLISH"
-
"MARK MORREALE, M.A., Chairperson"
-
"MISSION:"
-
"The English program offers concentrations in literature, writing, and theatre; the goals and principles underlying these concentrations are the same: (1) To increase the student’s appreciation and understanding of the literary, pragmatic, rhetorical, and dramatic uses of language."
-
"(2) To develop the student’s ability to write effectively in a variety of situations."
-
"(3) To help the student become more receptive to the many-sided pleasures of reading, writing, and oral presentation."
-
"(4) To enable the student to see how literary and nonliterary texts illuminate the complexity of human experience."
-
"(5) To heighten the student’s awareness of the moral and ethical implications of literary and nonliterary texts."
-
"(6) To foster the student’s intellectual, aesthetic, and professional creativity."
-
"The professional goals of the three concentrations are similar:"
-
"(1) To prepare students for careers utilizing analytical writing skills and/or performance skills in such fields as business, industry, education, government, theatre, and media."
-
"(2) To prepare students for graduate studies in literature and writing and in fields that require analytic, interpretive, and writing skills."
-
"(3) In conjunction with the Teacher Education Program, to prepare students for careers in secondary education."
-
"THEATRE PROGRAM"
-
"The Theatre Program is the production laboratory to the English Department’s Concentration in Theatre and Theatre Minor. Open to students of all majors, the Theatre Program produces two mainstage productions per year, professional workshops and student projects. A host of theatre courses are offered each year as well. The Marist Theatre Program also includes the student-theatre organization, MCCTA. MCCTA produces several productions a year, including a musical, a comedy or drama, an original play festival and an improv troupe."
-
"WRITING PROGRAM"
-
"The Writing Program includes not only the variety of courses offered by the English Department’s Concentration in Writing and Creative Writing Minor, but also the diverse array of student events and activities of interest to writers outside the classroom. This includes regular visits to campus by established writers in all genres, student readings, excursions to places of literary interest, and popular campus-wide events like the Red Fox Poetry slam. All Marist students are welcome to participate"
-
"104 English"
-
"in Writing Program events, regardless of major. Student organizations like the Literary Arts Society and Sigma Tau Delta (English Honors Society) are active in planning many of these annual events, and always welcome new members."
-
"CONCENTRATION IN LITERATURE"
-
"The literature concentration provides students with a sense of the historical development of the Western literary tradition, especially that of English and American Literature. Students also examine how that tradition is continually re-formed and reshaped as writers from previously excluded cultural traditions and once-marginalized groups are added to the canon. Students in the concentration develop the analytical skills and the critical language to describe, analyze, and evaluate literary texts."
-
"Internships within the English department offer students the opportunity to gain experience in research and teaching, while internships in the private and public sectors present students with the opportunity to gain work experience that utilizes the analytical, interpretive, and writing skills that the concentration fosters."
-
"CONCENTRATION IN WRITING"
-
"The writing concentration develops the student’s skills in a number of different forms: literary writing, technical and professional communication, print, and writing on-line. Students also have the opportunity to fulfill requirements for the concentration by taking writing courses offered by other divisions of the College (e.g., Writing for Radio and TV and a variety of Journalism courses)."
-
"Internships with business, media, and civic organizations offer students in the writing concentration the opportunity to gain work experience that utilizes the writing and analytical skills that the concentration develops."
-
"CONCENTRATION IN THEATRE"
-
"The concentration in theatre offers the student the opportunity to study theatre as the written and spoken work combined with movement in the art of performance."
-
"The play is studied for its literary qualities and as a blueprint for production. New, exciting approaches to interrogating the text and describing the complexity of its sign-system come from changes in the nature and function of literary criticism. While some courses include scene studies, others may be tied to on-campus productions."
-
"Internships in the broad arena of theatre-related activities are possible and require significant dedication to skill development related to the specific focus of the individual internship."
-
"HONORS IN ENGLISH"
-
"Up to 10% of graduating seniors in English will be awarded honors in the major on the basis of demonstrated excellence and achievement. Departmental faculty will select recipients each spring from among seniors meeting the following criteria:"
-
-
-
"(a) a minimum of 60 credits earned at Marist College; a minimum of 27 credits earned in English at Marist College; (b) a minimum cumulative G.P.A. of 3.25 overall;"
-
-
-
"(c) a minimum G.P.A. of 3.5 in English courses;"
-
-
-
"(d) distinguished achievement in a senior Capping Course project, which may take as its focus (1) research, (2) analysis, or (3) creative expression."

"MISSION:"
-
"The mission of the Department of Environmental Science & Policy is to educate students to become professionals who understand and solve environmental problems and, more broadly, to create a Marist College student body with a high level of environmental consciousness. The demands upon Earth’s natural resources and life-support systems increase each year as human population and consumption levels increase. Our ability to cope with such demands requires that we educate more of the population about environmental resources, problems, and solutions. Consequently, the Department educates majors to become knowledgeable, skilled professionals and educates non-majors to become highly responsible environmental citizens. Majors also are prepared for advanced courses and research in graduate programs."
-
"The Department is an interactive community of faculty and students, committed to better understanding the environment and the problems confronting it, and to finding solutions to correct them. Students are actively engaged by faculty having diverse expertise in natural and social sciences related to study of the environment."
-
"We offer a stimulating and relevant curriculum that incorporates classroom, laboratory, field, research, internship, and seminar experiences. Through this curriculum,"
-
"Environmental Science & Policy 111"
-
"we educate for fundamental understanding of the structure and function of natural, economic, and political systems as they relate to the environment. Students come to appreciate the details, complexity, and interrelatedness of systems and problems. We also examine the effects of society’s activities upon environmental resources and their relevance to human well-being."
-
"Given the College’s location, the Department seeks to integrate the ecological features and environmental affairs of the Hudson River Valley, as well as its rich history and culture, into its instructional, scholarly, service, and outreach activities. Moreover, the Department is committed to promoting and contributing to environmentally sustainable practices on campus and beyond. The Department is also committed to the continued professional growth of its faculty, through teaching refinement, scholarly activities, and service to various communities."
-
"PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:"
-
"The program provides a strong foundation while also having much flexibility. Two concentrations – Science and Policy – allow for different emphasis. Within each concentration students may choose from a wide range of courses to meet their interests, goals, and requirements. Three environmental minors are also available."
-
"Environmental Science & Policy overlaps with several of the natural and social sciences. Environmental considerations are essential in understanding the biology, behavior, and health of humans and other animals. Our curriculum is beneficial for students interested in zoology, botany, social sciences, liberal arts, business, and international affairs. Students with interests in these and other fields can apply their concern and interest for the environment in either the Science or Policy concentrations. Indeed, this program is well suited to dual majors and minors, allowing students to strengthen their undergraduate education and career preparation."
-
"Such preparation is also enhanced by our internships and research requirements."
-

"MISSION:"
-
"The Fashion Program builds on the College’s strong liberal arts tradition with a curriculum designed to keep pace with the changing needs of the fashion industry."
-
"Students develop creative, technical, and business skills that position them for successful employment in design. Internships are an integral part of the learning experience in the Fashion Program, as is the effective use of technology, including computer-aided design and industry-specific software."

"The Fashion Program for Fashion Design features a comprehensive curriculum leading to the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. The Fashion Design major trains students to create apparel for various markets considering creative, technical, and costing factors. Students develop skills in design, textiles, draping and flat pattern making, garment construction, and computer-aided design. In their senior year, they design and execute an apparel collection under the guidance of a professional designer to be shown at the school’s annual Silver Needle Runway Show. Fashion Design Majors may pursue a minor in Fashion Merchandising or Product Development."
-
"REQUIREMENTS FOR A BACHELOR OF FINE ARTS IN FASHION DESIGN"

"The Fashion Program for Fashion Merchandising features a comprehensive curriculum leading to the Bachelor of Science Degree. Students may choose from three concentrations — the Business concentration, Product Development concentration, or Fashion Promotion concentration."
-
"The Business concentration focuses on the planning, procurement, and marketing aspects of the fashion business. Students learn to research target markets, analyze business results, manage the supply chain, and develop strategies that effectively meet the needs of consumers. The Product Development concentration explores the development of private label or branded merchandise, supply chain management, and the use of product data management techniques. The Fashion Promotion concentration is geared toward the student seeking a career in fashion public relations or advertising, event production or on-line promotion. A capping course is required for all senior Merchandising students. The capstone project requires that the student relate his/her knowledge of fashion merchandising and program concentration, related courses and the core, often in collaboration with major fashion companies. Fashion Merchandising students may also pursue a Product Development minor."

"MISSION:"
-
"In a global and interdependent world, no education can be considered adequate without the skill of a second language and the ability to consider the perspective of other cultures. Used by over 200 million people in more than 50 countries around the world, French is a key language for international communication. It is an official working language at the UN, NATO, UNESCO, the International Olympic Committee, the European Union, the International Red Cross, and numerous NGOs. A double fluency in French and English is a competitive asset in the national and international job market for work in international business, the humanitarian and nonprofit sectors, the diplomatic world, the teaching professions, the fields of art history and fashion design, and to meet the requirements of various programs of graduate study."
-
"In addition, the study of French offers a tradition of inquiry into the meaning, structure, and practice of Language; a history of critical thought, literature, and fine arts that has shaped the Western tradition; and a window to the rich diversity of African, North American, and Asian cultures that still choose French as a primary or secondary mode of expression."
-
"The French Program affords the committed student the following special academic options:"
-
"(1) An interdisciplinary track for double majors designed to customize the language knowledge to the student’s second field of study, for maximum professional marketability."
-
"(2) The Marist Abroad Program in Paris, Aix-en-Provence or Marseille, featuring a stay with a French family and opportunity for community service involvement."
-
"Programs in Senegal and Morocco are also available."
-
"(3) Secondary school teacher certification."
-
"(4) The option to substitute several French courses to fulfill distributive Core/LS requirements in Mathematics, Science, History, or Literature, an arrangement which facilitates a double major or minor in French."

"GLOBAL STUDIES MINOR"
-
"CLAIRE KEITH, Ph.D., Coordinator"
-
"Global Studies is an interdisciplinary program intended to prepare students to live and work in, and make sense of, an increasingly interdependent and multicultural world. Students with an interest in international studies, as well as in careers in business, communications, education, environmental science, history, and politics, are encouraged to consider the minor as a supplement to their major. Courses in the minor focus on the critical study of cultures and systems outside of the United States, as well as on the political, economic, social, and cultural interrelationships within the contemporary global system."
-
"In addition to the required academic coursework and experience in world languages and cultures, the program actively encourages students to expand their global interests with a regional specialization in their Core and Major courses, and with participation in the Marist International Club, the Marist Foreign Film program, and in community or international organizations. Advanced students have the opportunity to give formal lectures on campus about their global projects or commitments and to link non-classroom international experiences with their chosen field of study. The Global Studies program also works closely with the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures to offer customized support for language study; with the Study Abroad Program to integrate new destinations; and with the Graduate School and Fellowship Advisor to prepare for post-graduation work in international fields."
-
"REQUIREMENTS FOR A MINOR IN GLOBAL STUDIES"

"Other Requirements:"
-
"Foreign Language requirement. Students must demonstrate the equivalent of one year of successful college-level study in a foreign language. They can do this by either (i) taking two college-level foreign-language courses at the elementary level, or one intermediate-level course, which would count as electives for the minor, or (ii) getting approval by the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures to waive the requirement by demonstrating the equivalent of one year of college-level study in a foreign language."
-
"Global Studies 127"
-
"An approved “international experience.” In this component of the minor, students must take part in an experiential project which is international in scope and will normally include foreign travel. The Marist Abroad program experience is strongly recommended, but not required. Other options for the international experience requirement must be approved by the Program Coordinator in consultation with the Global Studies Committee members. These may include independent work abroad with a humanitarian organization; study abroad during a leave of absence; or fluency in a culture other than North-American from extended living abroad. Participation in the experience must be certified by appropriate documentation."

"NICHOLAS MARSHALL, Ph.D., Chairperson"
-
"MISSION:"
-
"The History Major enables students to make sense of the world that they are inheriting. In order to accomplish this task, students must be grounded in their own historical experience, which should be placed within an emerging international context. In addition, they should recognize the ongoing tensions over the nature of identity: ethnicity, sexuality, class, gender, race, and nationality. To this end, we train students to analyze issues that engage them as citizens of communities, nations, and the world. Our students should expect to confront issues of social responsibility, human rights and dignity, and their role in supporting and encouraging social justice."
-
"The History Department systematically exposes students to a variety of areas: the United States, Europe, and those of the non-Western world. Within that framework, students have ample opportunity to pursue, in consultation with their advisors, specialized interests as career, life, or further educational goals may require. While we do not require study of a modern foreign language, we strongly recommend that path."
-
"History 129"
-
"A study of history provides students with a wide variety of skills both for living and for work. A comprehension of the past and the dynamics of change illuminate the present and enable students not only to exercise responsible citizenship, but to enjoy autonomy in an increasingly complex world. Additionally, the study and understanding of history instills or enhances a capacity for analysis and synthesis, and these transferable skills have applicability to a wide range of careers. History opens the door to careers in adolescent and secondary education as well as graduate studies, professional schools, doctoral programs, or law school. The history curriculum also makes a particular effort to advance a central mission of Marist College, to enhance our students’ awareness of enduring values-related issues."
-
"The discipline also offers a concentration in public history, a growing profession. This concentration introduces students to the various applications of historical research and interpretation that occur outside the classroom. Museums, libraries, archives, corporations, and cultural institutions employ public historians to manage resources. Students interested in such a concentration should contact Dr. Steven Garabedian."

"HUDSON RIVER VALLEY REGIONAL STUDIES MINOR"
-
"JAMES JOHNSON, Ph.D., Coordinator"
-
"The Hudson River Valley Regional Studies minor develops and fosters an understanding of the history, culture, and environment of this region and the place of regionalism more generally. This interdisciplinary minor assists students in understanding their community, the region, and connections of each to the larger world. It employs the ideas and methods of the liberal arts, natural and social sciences, and the fine arts. While the minor focuses on the Hudson River Valley, the knowledge, skills, and approaches to understanding developed can be applied to all regions. The minor is recommended for any student who plans to have a career that depends on ties to surrounding communities such as education, business, politics, or research in the natural or social sciences. Upon completion of the minor, students will understand how the regions where they have chosen to live and to work connect to the larger global community."
-
"REQUIREMENTS FOR A MINOR IN HUDSON RIVER VALLEY REGIONAL STUDIES"

"ANNE MATHEUS, Ph.D., Chairperson"
-
"MISSION:"
-
"Information Technology and Systems (ITS) provides a common foundation in computing and networking technologies, databases, information systems and business before branching into two concentrations: Information Technology (IT) and Information Systems (IS). An ITS major with a concentration in IS provides students with a broad background in the rapidly changing discipline of Information Systems that serves as a bridge between Computer Science and Business. The program’s courses offer a balance of technical and business skills that are pertinent to the development, implementation, and maintenance of information systems in a variety of organizational settings."
-
"An ITS major with a concentration in IT prepares students in the areas of networking technologies, web technologies, and multimedia. In the area of networking technologies, the hardware and software components of networks and issues related to the design, implementation, administration, and security of networks will be studied. Web technology courses will deal with the latest technologies in web development including client-side and server-side technologies and e-commerce systems."
-
"Students will also study multimedia and the design of graphical interfaces."

"The B.A. in Italian provides the foundational skills for spoken and written proficiency as well as essential knowledge of Italian culture through the study of a broad range of topics such as Italian literature, history, and contemporary ideas. The minor provides students with a solid base for the many professions linked with international endeavors and helps to prepare students to work in Italian and Italian American communities and institutions here and abroad."
-
"With the growing interest in Italian and Italian American studies at a national level, students of the Italian program will have the opportunity to expand their knowledge and language skills by integrating the major or minor into other fields, such as business, communications, economics, education, fashion, history, and political science, through interdisciplinary coursework that explores various theoretical and methodological approaches. The program strongly encourages students to fulfill their immersion experience through study abroad at Marist’s branch campuses in Italy or other venues available through the Marist International Programs (MIP)."
-
"REQUIREMENTS FOR A BACHELOR OF ARTS IN ITALIAN"

"MISSION:"
-
"Recognizing that curricula designed for traditional college students do not always meet the educational needs of adult learners, Marist offers a Bachelor’s degree program especially for adult learners. The Liberal Studies major provides the flexibility to tailor an education that meets an adult’s personal and professional objectives while earning either a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree. The Liberal Studies major is available to adult students over the age of 22."
-
"A Bachelor’s degree with the Liberal Studies major has three main components: the major credit component, the core credit component, and the elective credit component."
-
"The Major credit component requires a minimum of 45 credits. Of these 45 credits, a maximum of 15 credits can be transferred in from another college. Note: remaining transfer credits can be applied to the core and elective credit components following general college guidelines. Earning a Bachelor’s degree with a Liberal Studies major allows students the flexibility, with faculty advisement, to design their major credit component. The major credit component can be broken down into 2"
-
"or 3 areas of study. Some common areas of study within the Liberal Studies major are (but not limited to) the following:"
-
-
-
"• Paralegal Certificate"
-
"• Leadership"
-
"• Psychology"
-
-
-
"• Organizational Administration"
-
-
-
"• Professional Studies"
-
"• Communication"
-
"Students can choose courses from the many additional areas of study offered by Marist and design a unique program based on their own previous experience and personal and professional goals."
-
"The Core credit component is comprised of a six-course sequence drawn from various fields of study. These interdisciplinary courses fulfill the general education/"
-
"core curriculum distribution required in traditional majors. The sequence begins with an initial course that requires students to develop an individualized program of study that takes into account their past educational experiences and their future goals. Subsequent courses focus on integrating learning from various disciplines."
-
"The final course in the sequence is the Capping Experience seminar where students apply knowledge from their major in a final project that allows them to consider a significant contemporary issue from an interdisciplinary perspective."
-
"The School of Professional Programs also offers a cohort-based accelerated program as part of the Liberal Studies major. This program includes two predefined areas of study: 1 - Organizational Leadership and 2 - Communication. Students then need only choose a third area of study. The Organizational Leadership and Communication (OLC) program is open to students who have completed approximately two years of college-level work and meet transfer admission requirements."
-
"Students in this program have the opportunity to complete their undergraduate degree in as little as two years via an intensive, year-round, six-week course format that consists of one in-person class meeting each week, and additional learning activities conducted online using the iLearn course delivery platform."
-
"144 Liberal Studies"
-
"A fully online option is also available for those wishing to major in Liberal Studies. Online semesters are accelerated, comprised of two, 10-week terms. Students have the ability to attend full-time by taking two courses per online term."

"A minimum of forty-five (45) credits must be selected from a minimum of two different academic areas of study. If a student choses 3 areas of study, each area must have a minimum of 12 credits in each area of study. If a student chooses 2 areas of study, then a minimum of 21 credits in one area of study and 24 in the other are required. Preferably, a student will select courses from two or three different areas, following a sequence of increasing depth and sophistication in each area. Of the total 45 credits, at least 21 of those credits must be upper-level courses, usually designated as 300-400 level courses, taken at Marist."

"SUE LAWRENCE, Ph.D., Chairperson, Media Arts Department"
-
"MISSION:"
-
"The B.A in Media Studies and Production fosters critical thinking, strong hands-on skills, and creativity in the study and production of media. Drawing from a strong liberal arts foundation, Media Studies and Production integrates the history, theory, and analysis of visual culture with production experience and internship opportunities in the areas of television, film, interactive media, and game design. It prepares students for fulfilling careers in a wide-range of media industries."
-
"The program offers concentrations in Film & Television and Interactive Media & Game Design, as well as three minors in Digital Video Production, Interactive Media, and Cinema Studies."
-
"Opportunities for internships are readily available. The strong alumni network of the School of Communication and the Arts ensures that students intern in some of the top media organizations in the Northeast, including the major television networks, film studios, public relations firms, radio stations, game studios, design firms, technology companies, nonprofit and human-service agencies, and Fortune 500 companies. This on-the-job training prepares graduates to enter this exciting and ever-changing profession."
-
"OBJECTIVES:"
-
"The goals and objectives of the B.A. in Media Studies and Production are:"
-
"1. To develop students’ understanding of media theory and the ability to translate this knowledge successfully into practice through the gathering, evaluating, and synthesizing of information from various sources."
-
"2. To develop students’ ability to communicate effectively in writing and through various forms of media technologies."
-
"3. To develop students’ creative, innovative, aesthetic, and critical skills in producing visual, audio, and/or written works of excellence."
-
"MINORS"
-
"The program also includes minors in Digital Video Production, Interactive Media, and Cinema Studies for students outside Media Studies and Production who are interested in combining the study or the production of media with other disciplines. Students in Media Studies and Production cannot complete these minors. Students can, however, declare a double concentration in Film & Television and Interactive Media & Game Design."
-
"Foundation Courses (6 credits)"
-
"Students majoring in Media Studies and Production are required to take two foundation courses. These courses will be taken during the freshman year."

-
"MISSION:"
-
"The mission of the Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences is to provide students with a thorough understanding of the body of knowledge in the field of medical technology and its application in the medical laboratory setting."
-
"OBJECTIVES:"
-
"The program of study in medical technology is designed to achieve the following objectives:"
-
-
-
"• To educate students to perform competently as medical technologists at the career-entry level."
-
-
-
"• To develop in students problem-solving skills and leadership qualities in preparation for educational and supervisory positions in medical technology."
-
-
-
"• To cultivate in students an appreciation for continuing education and the need for lifelong learning in the field of laboratory medicine."
-
-
-
"• To provide students with the foundation for further study and advancement in many academic and professional areas."
-
"Although not a requirement for graduation, students are prepared and eligible to take national certification examinations. On completion of the degree requirements at Marist College and national certification, graduates are qualified to apply for a New York State Department of Education license to practice in clinical laboratories in the State of New York."
-
"Medical Technology offers exciting educational and career opportunities for students wishing to combine an interest in the sciences with laboratory medicine and diagnostic health care. As vital members of the health care team, medical technologists work closely with pathologists and other physicians to provide information needed for the diagnosis and therapeutic management of disease. Technologists may pursue diverse career opportunities. They may work in hospital, university, government, or industrial laboratories. They represent the upper division of medical laboratory personnel and can establish challenging careers in laboratory administration, specialized research, technical services, marketing, or in medical technology education. Graduates are qualified to enter graduate programs leading to masters and doctoral degrees."
-
"Medical Technology, with carefully chosen elective coursework, is an excellent major for students wishing to pursue professional degrees in human medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, physician/pathologist assistant programs, podiatry, physical therapy, and other health areas."
-
"The Medical Technology Program at Marist College is accredited by the National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences (NAACLS).* The program represents a cooperative effort between the College and regional clinical laboratories to provide a four-year curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Medical Technology. Students have a strong foundation in liberal arts and take courses in biology, chemistry, math, and computer science in preparation for advanced clinical courses. Students in clinical courses on campus gain experience in a simulated medical laboratory. Clinical courses include Hematology, Clinical Microscopy, Clinical Immunology/Immunohematology, Clinical Microbiology, and Clinical Chemistry. The curriculum emphasizes an understanding of the pathogenesis and manifestation of disease analyzed by laboratory testing and the theoretical principles supporting laboratory tests. Students spend six months in affiliated medical laboratories studying diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic monitoring of actual patient cases. They study side by side with professional medical technologists, utilizing state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation, while under the direction and supervision of Marist College faculty. The Marist program is formally affiliated with eight medical centers: MidHudson Regional Hospital of Westchester Medical Center, Poughkeepsie, NY; Vassar Brothers Medical Center, Poughkeepsie, NY; the Veterans Affairs Hudson Valley Health Care System, Castle Point, NY; Kingston Benedictine Hospitals Laboratory, Kingston, NY; St. Luke’s Cornwall Hospital, Newburgh/"
-
"Cornwall, NY; Columbia Memorial Hospital, Hudson, NY; Sharon Hospital, Sharon, CT; and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), New York, NY."
-
"All of these facilities are located within commuting distance of the College (except MSKCC, a voluntary rotation site) so students can continue to reside on campus."
-
"Students must achieve a minimum grade-point average of 2.5 in all required science and math courses to participate in the clinical portion of the program. A grade of C or better is required in each clinical course (I and II). All clinical I courses must be completed with a minimum grade of C prior to starting the internship phase of the program."
-
"The program provides an opportunity for students with an Associate degree in Medical Laboratory Technology or the Natural Sciences to complete a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Medical Technology at Marist College. These transfer students receive a maximum of 70 credits for courses taken at other accredited institutions of higher education and can usually complete the Marist College program in two years with full-time study."

-
"The Medical Technology Program offers structured programs in four specialty areas of medical laboratory science: Immunohematology, Clinical Microbiology, Hematology and Clinical Chemistry. Students opting for one of these structured programs must have the same educational experiences as a medical technology major and are therefore eligible for ASCP Board examination and certification in that discipline. Students who achieve certification hold the title of Blood Bank Technologist, Microbiology Technologist, Hematology Technologist or Chemistry Technologist, depending on the chosen area of study. The New York State Department of Education does not recognize certification in only one area for licensure."

Students in structured programs must maintain a minimum grade-point average of 2.5 in all required science and math courses in order to be eligible for an internship. They also will be required to fulfill the same phlebotomy requirements as the medical technology majors during clinical training. Internships, which begin in June and end in December, are complemented by an advanced lecture series on campus. Medical technology majors will be given first priority for internship placement if there is an insufficient number of internship slots due to increased class sizes."

"MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE STUDIES MINOR"
-
"JAMES G. SNYDER, Ph.D., Coordinator"
-
"Medieval and Renaissance Studies is an interdisciplinary program that offers students the ability to study the culture, history, literature, music, philosophy, politics, and religious traditions of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Students choose five electives from at least three different fields: English, Fine Arts (Art History and Music), History, Modern Languages and Cultures, and Philosophy & Religious Studies. Many of these courses also fulfill Core curriculum requirements. In addition students must fulfill a language requirement."
-
"The minor is appropriate for students interested in investigating the antecedents of modernity; in identifying enduring cultural and philosophical issues, themes, and problems; and in comparing and contrasting past and contemporary society. The minor will also prepare those students interested in graduate work in these fields, and to this end the acquisition of a foreign language at the intermediate level is required. The integration of study abroad into coursework is strongly encouraged."
-
"REQUIREMENTS FOR A MINOR IN MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE STUDIES"
-
"All students must take a minimum of five courses distributed throughout at least three of the following fields: English, Fine Arts (Art History and Music), History, Modern Languages and Cultures, and Philosophy & Religious Studies. The minor also requires students to take one intermediate language class in Italian, Spanish, or French, or an introductory course in Latin or Arabic. All courses in the minor must be completed with a C or better. Study abroad is strongly encouraged."

"PARALEGAL PROGRAM CERTIFICATE"
-
"ANNAMARIA MACIOCIA, J.D., Director"
-
"MISSION:"
-
"The objective of the Marist Paralegal Program is to offer organized and comprehensive training in the theory, information, and skills required to qualify as a legal assistant, in accordance with the guidelines established by the American Bar Association. The program is offered within the context of the educational purpose of the College and its commitment to a liberal arts, humanist, value-oriented curriculum. Our program meets its objective in a number of ways. Faculty in the program are drawn from Marist faculty and from practicing lawyers and law office administrators in the Mid-Hudson area. The program encourages a generalist orientation among its students, while stressing specific competency in paralegal studies. Program matriculates may satisfy the generalist requirements by having a baccalaureate degree, by being enrolled in the College’s baccalaureate program contemporaneously with enrollment in the Paralegal Program, or by having at least 36 general education college credits. Students acquire competency in paralegal studies by being required to complete successfully the following courses: Introduction to Law; Introduction to Legal Research And Writing; Family Law; Criminal Law; Real Property and Title Search; Business Law I; Wills, Trusts, Estates; and Civil Litigation and Practice."
-
"Upon graduation, students will be capable of functioning in all the required areas of study. As examples, a real estate closing, a simple will, a divorce proceeding, a memorandum of law utilizing research tools, and civil trial pleading are but some of the tasks our graduates understand and can complete. Additionally, grasping sufficient legal theory to be able to grow in the profession is required of our students. Successful completion of the program therefore qualifies graduates to serve the many legal needs of the Mid-Hudson area, while contributing to the advancement of the legal profession."
-
"The program combines required paralegal courses with general education courses. In order to receive the Paralegal Certificate, undergraduates accepted into the Paralegal Program are required to matriculate and pursue a major field of study leading to the baccalaureate degree. The certificate will be awarded after a student has completed all of the course requirements in paralegal studies (24 credits) and at least 36 additional credit hours toward the Marist baccalaureate degree. Students already holding baccalaureate degrees are eligible to receive the Paralegal Certificate upon completion of the paralegal course requirements (24 credits)."

"The Paralegal Certificate Program is approved by the American Bar Association."

"POLITICAL SCIENCE"

"JOANNE MYERS, Ph.D, Chairperson"
-
"MISSION:"
-
"The Political Science Department at Marist College sees its mission as one of enabling students to make sense of the political world and issues they are inheriting, instilling in them an interest in politics, political systems and institutions on all levels, in short, in political life and giving them the tools so they might enable the world to be a better place. We do so by offering a foundation in the four discipline subfields of political science – American government, political theory, comparative politics and international relations. The major is designed with flexibility so that students can develop their own interests in at least two subfields as they grow as scholars."
-
"Our goal is to assist and mentor students so they are able to think analytically and critically about political problems, both historical and contemporary, issues and ethical dilemmas. Students learn to read primary texts; collect, analyze and interpret data (especially utilizing the resources at the Marist Institute for Public Opinion (MIPO)), distinguish facts that are pertinent to their elegant arguments and communicate – both written and orally, effectively and persuasively. By grappling with the great issues of our time and of the past, the faculty guide students to appreciate the dynamic interplay of theory, methodology and practice in understanding the political world."
-
"We are committed to helping our students become skilled and proficient communicators. We all recognize that learning to write well is important in the field of political science. To this end, we all emphasize not only the quantity and variety of writing assignments, but the quality of the finished work. Likewise, we also emphasize the ability to craft a good solid argument both orally and in writing. While the classroom is at the heart of the liberal arts education, we also recognize that learning is not limited to the time in class or within the walls of the classroom itself. One of the department’s goals is to turn the entire world into our classroom by"

"taking advantage of the unique opportunities we have at Marist and beyond, including The Marist Institute For Public Opinion (Marist Institute), the FDR Presidential Library, town meetings, academic conferences, the Model United Nations, internships, the Albany Semester, the Washington Semester, Marist Abroad, Pre-law and the American Bar Association approved Paralegal programs. Consistent with the mission of Marist, Political Science challenges students to confront the perennial values and issues involved in politics. The department aims to prepare students for responsible citizenship in our changing world, and to assist students in developing lifelong learning skills and a broad grounding in a liberal arts education. Our students should be well prepared for graduate or law school, the workplace – including public service, non-profits, the media, and corporations – and in the communities in which they reside."

-
"MISSION:"
-
"The psychology major at Marist provides a rich and rewarding educational experience within a strong liberal arts tradition. Psychology courses explore psychological theory as well as the application of psychological principles. The range of application varies from experiences in psychological research courses, where students actually conduct research, to developmental courses, where students can see the relevance of applying principles of development in their own lives."
-
"As students become familiar with the psychological literature and its applications, they develop a professional orientation that prepares them for entry-level jobs in the field and acceptance to graduate schools in psychology. This professional orientation is supported by field/service learning experiences that are available in the junior/senior year in a local human-service agency, school, or research setting. This undergraduate preparation as a psychology major is valuable not only for students who choose advanced graduate study in psychology, but also as preparation for elementary/special education teacher training programs as well as a wide array of positions generally included under the fields of business management and communication or the pursuit of advanced degrees in other areas such as law or medicine."
-
"Teaching Certification in Childhood Education/Students with Disabilities 1–6"
-
"Psychology majors have the opportunity to participate in a teacher certification program, which integrates a strong professional studies sequence in Childhood Education/Students with Disabilities (1–6) with their academic major and the Core/Liberal Studies program."
-
"Graduates of this program earn a B.A. Degree in Psychology and complete requirements for dual initial teaching certification. Freshman psychology majors interested in pursuing this option should contact the Department of Education, Dyson 388. Information about the major requirements, Core/Liberal Studies requirements, and required courses in the certification sequence can be found in the Education Department section of the catalog."

"PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION CONCENTRATION"
-
"JOANNE MYERS, Ph.D., Director"
-
"Marist College currently offers both a graduate program leading to a Masters Degree in Public Administration and an undergraduate concentration, available to students regardless of their major field of study. The undergraduate concentration is interdisciplinary, drawing from political science, business, economics, mathematics, and computer science. It provides students with a professional education in management, emphasizing the quantitative and qualitative techniques of analysis necessary for a successful career in government and not-for-profit organizations. A Five-Year B.A.-M.P.A. program is available for qualified students. See Director for more information."
-
"REQUIREMENTS FOR A CONCENTRATION IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION"
-
"Depending upon a student’s major field of study, the courses remaining to complete the concentration vary. This is because students complete some of this interdisciplinary concentration in the process of fulfilling their major field requirements. Check with the Program Director for advisement."

"The Marist College Social Work Program is dedicated to preparing generalist social work practitioners committed to promoting the well-being of all people and their communities, through an integrated curriculum design grounded in the core values, ethics, and traditions of the profession and that provides the opportunity to master professional knowledge and skills. The Program fosters collaborative relationships with the diverse human services community in the Hudson River Valley to enrich student learning both in the classroom and in the field. The program challenges faculty and students to become social work leaders in the development of a more just society locally and globally."
-
"The Marist College BSW Program has a curriculum which is grounded in the profession’s purpose and values, informed by the program’s context and is driven by the mission of the institution. The BSW Program curriculum prepares its graduates for entry level generalist practice through the mastery of the 10 Social Work Program Competencies (SWPC) and 41 associated practice behaviors as required by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE). The goal of competency-based education is to ensure that students can successfully integrate and apply the competencies in practice with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities."
-
"Competencies are measurable practice behaviors that are based on social work communities. Competencies are measurable practice behaviors that are based on social work knowledge, values, and skills. The total social work curriculum provides opportunities in the classroom and in a range of field education experiences for students to master the practice skills necessary to perform as competent and ethical generalist social work practitioners."
-
"Advisement is provided throughout the program. Advisement plays a critical role, particularly in readying students for thresholds within the major and in evaluating their performance as potential social workers."
-
"Minors are available in Social Work and Sociology. The Social Work minor consists of 15 credits and the Sociology minor requires 15 credits. Students should contact the Social Work Program Director to select the appropriate sequence of required and elective courses. Students are advised that the minors in Social Work and Sociology are not accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of the Council on Social Work Education.

"MISSION:"
-
"Communication through language is at the core of human experience, and the study of a foreign language provides a powerful key to successful interaction. The ability to communicate efficiently and sensitively in another language with people of different cultural backgrounds can only enhance one’s professional advancement in any career. The Department of Modern Languages and Cultures aims to enrich students’ education by helping them gain a rich preparation for the future through the support"
-
"Spanish 179"
-
"of global studies, teacher education, international tracks in other disciplines and, in general, career opportunities in key areas of domestic and international service where knowledge of a foreign language facilitates and increases the level of success."
-
"The Spanish area of the division affords the serious student of a foreign language the following special academic programs: (1) Marist International Programs, featuring individual placement, generally during the junior year, in Spain (Madrid, Granada) or Latin America (Argentina, Chile, and Cuba among others)."
-
-
-
"(2) Bilingual Education concentration."
-
-
-
"(3) Secondary school teacher certification."
-
-
-
"(4) Latin American and Caribbean Studies program."
-
"The major outcome of a modern language education is greater self-awareness and an increased understanding of and ability to communicate with people of different cultural backgrounds. In addition, career opportunities in many key areas of domestic and international services are enhanced for the person proficient in a modern language."
-
"Students may apply two language courses at the intermediate level or above as well as a civilization/culture course and two Foreign Language literature courses toward fulfilling the distributive Core/LS requirements. This arrangement facilitates, with proper planning and early implementation, a double major (or minor) with other disciplines such as Political Science, Communications, Criminal Justice, and other majors."
-
"Spanish Majors are urged to spend two semesters abroad in a Spanish-speaking country, but are limited to no more than two semesters and twelve or fifteen credits in the major, according to the chosen track."

"Women’s Studies is a multidisciplinary academic program that focuses on gender as a significant cultural and cognitive category. The minor in Women’s Studies exposes students to the intellectual, political, and aesthetic contributions of women to human culture, and examines how gender has influenced the lives, status, and opportunities of all people. Attention is paid to the ways in which gender intersects with race, class, and ethnicity to shape social structures and individual experiences. Courses provide students with a critical approach to the study of history, political science, literature, philosophy, religion, economics, communication, social sciences, the natural sciences, and management, incorporating scholarship on women, gender, and feminist theory. The program advances the Marist tradition of preparing students to develop a global perspective that recognizes and respects diversity."
-
"Students are required to take an interdisciplinary Introduction to Women’s Studies course and five other courses distributed among at least two different disciplines for a total of 18 credits. Courses that may be applied to the minor include the following regular offerings, as well as designated special topics and cross-disciplinary courses."
